It's all about the money. Nothing personal. Nothing human. This is just the way how, per one's suggestion, things are supposed to be going.

A stall in evolution process for human beings. A Plato after a technology rise. Should we then fall? Happily, unlikely. It wouldn't be that much of a profit for the one. Likely, we'll get balancing between up and down. For eternity, one will wish. That will bring more cash, obviously. The marketing Utopia taught at school doesn't work anymore.
